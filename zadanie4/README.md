## Backend

Created with [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/), [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/), [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html).

Enables:

- registering new account
- authentication via username/password (with use of [Passport.js](https://www.passportjs.org/)), afterwards returning JWT for use in subsequent requests
- RBAC (Role Based Access Control) implemented with Nest guards

You can explore available endpoints through SwaggerUI, that is available at `http://localhost:3000/swagger`.

Before running the app you need to create a `.env` file and provide value for each variable defined in [`.evn.example` file](backend/.env.example).

## Frontend

Created with [Angular](https://angular.io), [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [ng-bootstrap](https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/).
